    "### 1. Analyze small discrete-time recurrent neural networks (2 or 3 simple neurons)\n",
    "Idea: Explore basic neural dynamics with small RNNs\n",
    "Simple 2-neuron RNN: Start by modeling a simple recurrent neural network with 2 neurons. Let each neuron have a self-connection and be connected to the other neuron. The update rule can be something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "x_1(t+1) = f(w_11* x_1(t) + w_12*x2(t) + b1)\n",
    "\n",
    "x_2(t+1) = f(w_21* x_1(t) + w_22 *x2(t) + b1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to Explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What types of behavior do you observe for different parameter settings? Can you find cases where the system exhibits fixed points, limit cycles, or chaos?\n",
    "- Investigate how the type of activation function influences the system's dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Add complexity with a 3-neuron RNN\n",
    "- Model a 3-neuron RNN, where each neuron is connected to the others. The dynamics become richer with an additional neuron, and you may observe more complex behaviors like multi-period oscillations and chaotic dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Analyze the parameter space for chosen parameters (weights and biases)\n",
    "Idea: Explore bifurcation in parameter space\n",
    "- Varying weights and biases: Use the two-neuron or three-neuron RNN model and systematically vary weights and biases to map out different regions in parameter space. You'll likely find:\n",
    "    - Fixed-point attractors (steady states)\n",
    "    - Periodic orbits (cycles)\n",
    "    - Chaotic attractors\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "- Choose 1-2 parameters (e.g., weight, bias) and create a bifurcation diagram by plotting the long-term behavior of the system as you vary the parameter(s).\n",
    "- Identify critical points where qualitative changes in the system's behavior occur (e.g., transition from fixed-point to periodic oscillations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Study stability of fixed points\n",
    "- Jacobian matrix analysis: For specific sets of weights and biases, derive the Jacobian matrix of the system and analyze the eigenvalues to study the stability of fixed points.\n",
    "    - Stable fixed points will have eigenvalues with magnitudes less than 1.\n",
    "    - When eigenvalues cross a certain threshold, you may observe bifurcations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Plot orbits for different chosen parameterizations\n",
    "- Idea: Visualize neuron trajectories\n",
    "Phase space plots: For specific parameter settings, simulate the system for multiple time steps and plot the orbit of the neuron activations in phase space (e.g., plotting x_1(t) vs. x2(t)). This can show:\n",
    "- Fixed points (the system converges to a single point)\n",
    "- Limit cycles (closed orbits indicating oscillations)\n",
    "- Strange attractors (chaotic trajectories)\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Explore transient dynamics\n",
    "- Longer vs shorter time scales: Investigate whether the system exhibits transient chaos or other interesting behavior before settling into an attractor. Plot the orbit over both short and long time scales to visualize this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Show the basins of attraction for a region with co-existing attractors\n",
    "Idea: Map out basins of attraction\n",
    " -For certain parameter choices, there may be multiple attractors (e.g., multiple fixed points or periodic cycles). The basins of attraction are regions in the initial state space that converge to different attractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: \n",
    "- Choose a specific region in the x1-x2 or x1-x2-x3 state space and simulate the system for a grid of initial conditions.\n",
    "- Color the different regions based on which attractor the system converges to. This will create a basin of attraction plot, where different colors indicate different attractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Explore attractor coexistence\n",
    "- Coexisting attractors: For specific parameter choices, find cases where the system has two or more co-existing attractors, such as two different fixed points or a fixed point and a periodic orbit. Map out the basins of attraction in this case and investigate the boundaries between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Suggestions for Investigation:\n",
    "Idea: Investigate chaotic behavior in small RNNs\n",
    "- Investigate parameter regimes where the RNN exhibits chaotic behavior. You can identify chaos through:\n",
    "    - Lyapunov exponents: If the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive, the system is chaotic.\n",
    "    - Phase space plots: Chaotic trajectories tend to be irregular and non-repeating, unlike periodic orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Compare different types of RNN architectures\n",
    "- You can compare the dynamics of different RNN architectures, such as:\n",
    "    - Fully connected vs. partially connected networks: How does removing certain connections (weights) influence the system's dynamics?\n",
    "    - Different activation functions: Compare sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and step functions to observe how the choice of non-linearity affects system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Steps for Exploration\n",
    "1. Start with simple systems: Begin by simulating a 2-neuron system and explore a wide range of weights and biases to develop intuition about the dynamics.\n",
    "2. Gradually add complexity: Move to 3-neuron systems and explore co-existing attractors, chaotic dynamics, and basins of attraction.\n",
    "3. Visualize everything: Use phase space plots, bifurcation diagrams, and basin-of-attraction maps to visualize the rich dynamics of these small RNNs.\n",
    "4. Explore the literature: Reading articles by Frank Pasemann and Randall Beer will provide a deeper theoretical foundation and additional examples for modeling RNN dynamics."
