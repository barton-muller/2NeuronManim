# 2 Neuron Dynamical Systems
### Barton Muller, Sofia Wellman, Bram Timmermans
A project for Delft Nanobiology MSc Year 1 Modelling Dynamical Systems Course, looking at periodicity in 2 (or more) neuron systems.
This was very much a working directory.
The results are showcased in [2NeuronDemonstration](https://github.com/barton-muller/2NeuronDemonstration).
Manim was used to make some visually appealing plots!
